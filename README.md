This is a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 
  
##### output

The project must generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a well formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (link to GitHub profile, office number or School)
